    <!-- Note
    ***Id is always unique for every element. None of the two elements can have the same Id.It is just like an aadhar number for a person. No person can posses two aadhar number at the same time. Multiple person cnanot have same aadhar number.  
    ***Classes refers to the groups in which some properties or habits of the element can be clasified. For example two people can have the same interest in cars, mobiles, clothing and accessories.
    ***If we write something inside a class after giving a space it means that it is another class. Example-> class="red yellow cat". It has three classes, red orange and cat.
    ***Above all thing is just like two people can have same interest, can wear same clothes, can have same car and other stuffs but cannot have same aadhar number or fingerprint. 
    ***One class can have multiple elements and multiple elements can have the same class. But One Person cant have more than one aadhar number and multiple person cant hvae the same aadhar number.
    ####Two elements can have the same class but can never have the same id. -->
